# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will generally meet weekly, barring extreme circumstances. Each meeting will last as long as it needs to for us to assign tasks and check progress, and potentially longer if we choose to utilize this time to work together on deliverables. We have created a discord group that we will use to share links, update on pushes to the github repository, and communicate about goals and work accomplished. 


2. **Assistance** 
Teammates can use discord to contact each other. Responses should be expected within a day usually, or within an hour if there is a due date or deadline upcoming that day or the next.


3. **Respect** 
    Be nice and listen to others' ideas. If someone can’t get a word in while in person, they can use discord to communicate ideas that were missed.
## Collaboration
    
4. **Work Distribution** 
When assigning work for the project, at every meeting we will assess what needs to be done in the coming interval of time, evaluate the things that each member has been currently working on, and determine if any changes need to be made. Based on past work and each member’s interest in the components we will assign work for the coming week and continue to evaluate and make changes.


5. **Time Commitment** 
We will expect to do about 3 hours of independent work each week per member, not including group meetings and check ins. Because most of the work is independent, each member will be able to schedule the work at a time that works for them. If one person has a particularly heavy work load or unexpected obligation, we will be expected to notify the other members as soon as possible or bring it up at the meeting prior to the obligation so we can plan accordingly and redistribute work.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If work cannot be done on time due to various difficulties, they can mention it over discord or at a meeting, and we can redistribute work to other members as needed. If this or other problems persist, we can give a strongly worded warning and a very brief period of time to make up for missed work. Members being late to meetings will be met with a warning.
